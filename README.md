This package provides an implementation of doublelength floating point arithmetic as described in the Reference. The main idea behind doublelength arithmetic is to represent the answer to an operation `a ∘ b` by the sum of two floating-point numbers `z + zz`. The numbers `z` and `zz` are known as the _head_ and _tail_ respectively of the doublelength floating point number; the head is the result of `a ∘ b` in the original precision of the ordinary floating point arithmetic, and the tail is the correction term such that the sum `z + zz`, evaluates as closely as possible to the operation `a ∘ b` in _twice_ the original precision. (The Reference below provides tighter bounds on the precision, but works out to approximately twice the original precision, less 4 bits.)

## The `DoublelengthFloat` type

This package defines a new type, `DoublelengthFloat`, which wraps the `head` and `tail` components. `DoublelengthFloat` is a subtype of `FloatingPoint` and takes a single type parameter `T` which must be a subtype of `FloatingPoint`.

The following methods are defined on `DoublelengthFloat`s:

Julia method | Name in (Dekker, 1971)
-- | --
`+(a::DoublelengthFloat{T}, b::DoublelengthFloat{T}) -> DoublelengthFloat{T}` | `sum2`
`-(a::DoublelengthFloat{T}, b::DoublelengthFloat{T}) -> DoublelengthFloat{T}` | `sub2`
`⋅(a::T, b::T) -> DoublelengthFloat{T}` | `mul12`
`*(a::DoublelengthFloat{T}, b::DoublelengthFloat{T}) -> DoublelengthFloat{T}` | `mul2`
`/(a::DoublelengthFloat{T}, b::DoublelengthFloat{T}) -> DoublelengthFloat{T}` | `div2`
`√(a::DoublelengthFloat{T}) -> DoublelengthFloat{T}` (`sqrt`) | `sqrt2`

The elementary operations `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` (together with `sqrt`) are closed under the field of `DoublelengthFloat`s. Additionally, a multiplication method `⋅` is provided which produces a `DoublelengthFloat{T}` from multiplying two `T`s together.
